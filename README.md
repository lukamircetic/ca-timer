# Combat Achievements Timers

Adds countdown timers to non-raid bosses that have speedrun tasks.

Currently supported bosses:
* Hespori
* Vorkath
* Zulrah

## Usage

In the sidebar use the dropdown menu to select from time options or "Off" which will turn off timer for a given boss.
Everytime you go to kill a boss, when the kill starts it will have a countdown timer for the current goal.
